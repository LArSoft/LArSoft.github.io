This is a compromise, but there’s no other simple way to have this work (without more major changes to how LArG4 works).

AuxDetReadoutGeometry now first tries to find volumes with Sensitive in their name in the gdml file, and if it does not find any it defaults to looking for AuxDet volumes. AuxDetReadout now has a data member to keep track of which sensitive volume in an AuxDet that it correponds too. The sensitive volume is now part of the name used to describe the sensitive volume to G4. AuxDetSimChannel now knows what sensitive volume it corresponds to as well. Make it possible for old code to still work by providing defaults for the sensitive volume value in the methods that now take that parameter.

-   2014-12-27 Tyler Alion : Rewrite AuxDetReadoutGeometry to find and make AuxDets the same way that the Geometry service does. Change AuxDetReadout constructor to take a name as well as a number attached to the AuxDet.

The number then becomes the AuxDetSimChannel number. The old way was not flexible enough fo new users, but can now work with any GDML volume whose name starts with volAuxDet, regardless of what comes after. This GDML volume can also be anywhere in the volume tree under the World.

-   2014-01-17 Brian Rebel : AddPoint(int x, int y) called DoAddPoint(int x, int y) which was commented out and no longer defined. AddPointReturnMax(int x, int y) was also not defined. I removed AddPoint, DoAddPoint and AddPointReturnMax(int x, int y). The single call to AddPoint(int x, int y) was changed to AddPointReturnMax(int x, int y). (Do)AddPointReturnMax(int x, int y, int\* maxx, int\* maxy) were changed to return a std::vector\<int\> with the overall maximum value and the x y location of that maximum value and to have the signature of (Do)AddPointReturnMax(int x, int y). The relevant bits of code were changed to follow this new signature and return type. This change was required to build properly with CMake which flagged the undefined DoAddPoint and failed. Also removed references to SaveBMPFile as that function was not defined and only called once. Instead use HLSSaveBMPFile.

-   2013-12-13 Brian Rebel : make the IonizationAndScintillation singleton save a pointer to the current G4Step. Also require the Reset(step) method to be called before asking for the number of electrons, photons, or total energy deposition from the IonizationAndScintillation singleton. The Reset method will check its pointer against the current step and do the calculation if the steps are different.
-   2013-12-13 Brian Rebel : roll nutools version forward. included explicit linking in of libEventDisplayBase to libEventDisplay\_service.

-   2013-12-12 Brian Rebel : add extra entries to FHICL\_FP using the \${LARSOFT} environmental variable. For LArSoft users the effect is to have \$SRT\_PUBLIC\_CONTEXT listed in the path an extra 2 times.

-   2013-12-11 Brian Rebel : flatten more nested loops
-   2013-12-11 Brian Rebel : flatten out a bunch of nested for loops making use of PlaneIDs instead. also change a bunch of abs and fabs calls to std::abs to be sure the right type is automatically used
-   2013-12-11 Brian Rebel : remove apparently unnecessary nested loops over cryostat/tpc/plane. Doing so also prevents a possible error with the algorithm in that the p index in the plane loop was getting redefined in loops over protoshowers that were contained within that loop.
-   2013-12-11 Brian Rebel : jumped the gun on the last change
-   2013-12-11 Brian Rebel : change to using ifdh\_art v1.2.10

-   2013-12-10 Tingjun Yang : add clustercrawler configuration for argoneut
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : add methods to return a set of PlaneIDs for the full detector. These methods should allow users to remove the last of the nested for loops over cryostats/tpcs/planes
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : more changes to remove nested loops in favor of looping over either maps or the set of geometry views
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : change nested for loops over cryostat/tpc/planes to make use of map\<geo::PlaneID, std::vector\<art::Ptr\> \> and loop over that instead.
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : change some art::PtrVector to std::vector\< art::Ptr\> to accommodate some changes in ClusterFinder
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : add ability to get a set of the different View\_ts used in the current detector

-   2013-12-10 Tingjun Yang : update fcl for argoneut
-   2013-12-10 Brian Rebel : add the -gdwarf-2 so that totalview will be able to interpret the debugging symbols produced by gcc. This flag is necessary because gcc 4.8.1 (the gccc with art 1.08.10) produces symbols that are newer than totalview or gdb understand
-   2013-12-09 Herbert Greenlee : Fix for FileCatalogMetadataExtras broken by art v1\_08\_xx.
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : use the geo::PlaneID object and a map of those to vectors of hits to avoid looping over all cryostats/tpcs/planes and just loop over the map entries. This change improves the speed of the module for events with lots of hits as we are no longer looping over all hits at the inner-most loop in a set of 3 nested loops. The speed for other events is effectively the same as before.
-   2013-12-09 Lynn Garren : properly initialize the constructor
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : make sure to link in the FHICL included files and strip more away from the path for external products
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : make use of range based for loops and use the geo::PlaneID to tidy up comparisons of whether we have the correct cryostat/tpc/plane combination for 2D drawing
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : explicitly remove the old log file before running doxygen.
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : add methods to get the view and signal type for a plane using the PlaneID struct
-   2013-12-09 Brian Rebel : make the minimum fraction of the total energy of a hit that a particle has to contribute to it to be considered in efficiency and purity calculations a tunable parameter

-   2013-12-09 Tingjun Yang : update fcl for bo
-   2013-12-08 Eric Church : A fix to get in Sppt-Trk associations appropriately added to the Stizitcher.
-   2013-12-08 Brian Rebel : make sure to update the setup directory before attempting to source the setup script in the nightly build script. This will prevent the circumstance that the first build after a switch in ART release fails to build because the ups products are setup for the previous set of ART and other external packages.

-   2013-11-06 Brian Rebel : back out the EDAnalyzer(pset) call in the ctor initialization list for now by commenting out the pset bit - that way the change to art v1.08.09 will be less painful. just another query/replace operation.
-   2013-11-06 Brian Rebel : remove leading job/ from include statements in .fcl files. the job/ is unnecessary as the FHICL\_FILE\_PATH variable, which is what is used to search for the .fcl files by ART already has the job directory in it.

-   2013-09-08 Brian Rebel : change array declared with a variable length into a std::vector. NEVER declare variable length arrays, ALWAYS use std::vectors if you do not know how long the array will be. std::vectors are still almost always preferable to arrays. Remove unnecessary library dependencies from the GNUmakefile
-   2013-09-08 Tyler Alion : Remove the outdated APA frame volumes from lbne35t4apa. They were covering most of the optical detectors.
-   2013-09-08 Brian Rebel : specify ioread rule for backwards compatibility between LBNE10ktPhotons and SimPhotonsLite. Reorder entries to put all the data product definitions together in the file for easier updating in the future.

-   2013-09-07 Jonathan Insler : removed CalWireLBNE34kt\_module.cc from repository
-   2013-09-07 Jonathan Insler : removed SimWireLBNE34kt\_module.cc from repository
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : Fix defaults again… Also transition this package to using the configuration keyword lbnefd in place of lbne34kt and lbne10kt. Having one for each is excessive since they are thus far treated completely the same except that a different GDML file is imported. So now the configuration approach is to have the FD configuration, and in geometry\_lbne.fcl select the desired GDML – this fits in nicely with the several other FD-related geometries.
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : Change the View and SignalType functions to work for multiple TPCs – No functionality change whatsoever for other geometries. Also complete the break out of the nested for loops in ChannelToWire. Add ICARUS into Geometry\_service.
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : Add ICARUS hard coding of wire and plane pitch.
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : ICARUS geometry tune ups. Fix origin. Generate it with the actual pitch. Improve wire placement method in the generate script.
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : Put geometry configurations in one place. Detector specific files hold each different configuration, geometry.fcl ties them together and holds a standard configuration (a copy of microboone\_geo.) Also add a configuration for the ICARUS T600 detector.
-   2013-09-07 Tyler Alion : Add detector id for ICARUS T600
-   2013-09-07 Bruce Baller : ClusterCrawler fixes

-   2013-09-07 Brian Rebel : make SaveBMPFile a method of the module
-   2013-09-07 Brian Rebel : make SaveBMPFile a method of the module
-   2013-09-07 Brian Rebel : quite some compilation problems. For NestS1Light remove the code that has been moved into NestAlg. For OpParamSD.cxx temporarily comment out call to SimpleWireplanAction constructor with 2 parameters until it can be fixed by experts. Define dummy implementation for NestAlg::GetGasElectronDriftSpeed until experts can be contacted.
-   2013-09-06 Kazuhiro Terao : ADDITION

-   2013-09-05 Brian Rebel : changes to complete the switch to using the IonizationAndScintillation singleton for calculating the number of ionization electrons and scintillation photons for each step. Split the ISCalculation::Reset methods into a Reset method that sets the fEnergyDeposit, fNumIonElectrons and fNumScintPhotons variables to 0. and a CalculateIonizationAndScintillation method that sets them based on the calculations.
-   2013-09-04 Herbert Greenlee : Get rid of assertion that efficiency is between 0 and 1.
-   2013-09-04 Jonathan Insler : added G4StepLimiter to PhysicsList to enable step size upper limit
-   2013-09-04 Tyler Alion : Fix bad operator bug, this passes geometry test when the channel map is in a certain mode. Solution in progress.
-   2013-09-04 Tyler Alion : Add basic ICARUS geometry file based off of a few of their NIM papers. No art configurations yet.
-   2013-09-04 Eric Church : Tweak the GNUMakefile, which MUST stay here, even though we don’t yet build NuWro in the nightly build. The ubooneoffline repository customers will use it.
-   2013-09-04 Brian Rebel : Add new UserAction to Reset the IonizationAndScintillation singleton with each step. Will turn this UserAction on once there is signoff to do so.
-   2013-09-03 Bruce Baller : ClusterCrawler fixes
-   2013-09-03 Bruce Baller : ClusterCrawler fixes
-   2013-09-03 Eric Church : Add only a comment regarding NuWro.

-   2013-09-02 Brian Rebel : adjust histogram axis limits and binning
-   2013-09-02 Brian Rebel : remove reference to IonAndScintAna
-   2013-09-02 Brian Rebel : remove the IonAndScintAna module in favor of making histograms that are filled with each step in the IonizationAndScintillation singleton.
-   2013-09-02 Tyler Alion : Check for empty signal vector in fewer steps.
-   2013-09-02 Tyler Alion : Make Wire constructor more efficient by only uncompressing RawDigit if the supplied signal list is empty. Saves about 20 seconds in the 10kt geometry calibration, and WILL NOT effect the functionality.
-   2013-09-02 Tyler Alion : Add geometry to parallel design proposal involving fitting an extra anode plane in the same volume. Not really ready for studies until a few more decisions are made, though.

-   2013-09-02 Andrzej Szelc : introduycing first version of ShowerSelectorFilter. Still Somewhat rough around the edges.
-   2013-09-02 Tyler Alion : Hooks to use the newer lbne35t 4apa geometry. Default is still left to the old lbne35t for now so that current/old root files work.
-   2013-09-02 Tyler Alion : New 35t geometry with slimmer APAs. It’s possible to define different wire angles for each APA. There are the right number of (vertical) optical detectors, but the y positions are placeholders. Though this will draw with lbne\_geo.C and there are no overlaps, root does have to handle 2 invalid syntax errors which aren’t handled in the LArSoft import. Still looking for this evasive bug.
-   2013-09-01 Andrzej Szelc : Add preliminary Shower/track differentiating function. Also some utilities like Principal components and other Cluster parameter calculation. Fix bug where multiple instances of the Alg would balk. Code is somewhat gritty a clean-up will come
-   2013-09-01 Brian Rebel : add saving of random numbers to fast optical prodsingle fcl file
-   2013-08-31 Brian Rebel : put try/catch block around the call to Geometry::PositionToTPC and for now just move on to the next IDE in the set if an exception is thrown
-   2013-08-30 Brian Rebel : adjust to new interface to CryostatGeo::PositionToTPC
-   2013-08-30 Brian Rebel : switch abs to std::abs, adjust to using Geometry::PositionToTPC rather than access the cryostat object and then do PositionToTPC
-   2013-08-30 Brian Rebel : set limits on the frequency of GeometryBadInputPoint messages
-   2013-08-30 Brian Rebel : allow user to define an epsilon when looking for which cryostat or TPC a given position in the geometry is located. Also remove fNBadVol counter in favor of using the message facility for limiting the number of messages. Will commit to Utility/messageservice.fcl to make the limit a default.
-   2013-08-30 Brian Rebel : module to validate ionization and scintillation code.
-   2013-08-30 Herbert Greenlee : Fix seed import bug for Kalman Hit track finder.
-   2013-08-30 Herbert Greenlee : Tweak Kalman Hit track finder fcl parameters.
-   2013-08-29 Tingjun Yang : Fix a bug when induction hits = collection hits. Eric&Tingjun
-   2013-08-28 Tyler Alion : Make the default the full geometry still.
-   2013-08-28 Tyler Alion : Add example lines to choose a different gdml file to be associated with the lbne10kt fcl keyword. Specifically for choosing a significantly smaller file so that work can be done in FD APAs in a reasonable compute time, while leaving the true, full geometry unaltered.
-   2013-08-28 Tyler Alion : Add gdml files with minimal volWorld size, only one cryostat, and only 4 APAs in that cryostat. Each APA has the same x center; there are two-by-two vertically and in the z direction. Files for each 36 and \~45 degree configurations.
-   2013-08-28 Brian Rebel : add property for the ELECTRICFIELD in LAr, set it using the LArProperties service
-   2013-08-28 Brian Rebel : add flag to pick which of the Ionization and Scintillation Calculators to use, default it to using the separate methods
-   2013-08-28 Brian Rebel : New design pattern for using/specifying different algorithms to determine the number of scintillation photons and ionization electrons for each step from G4. The IonizationAndScintillation object is a singleton that is only accessible through an Instance() method - there is no public constructor. This singleton owns a pointer to the base class representation of ISCalculation. The different algorithms to determine the number of ionization (I) electrons and scintillation (S) photons are derived from this base class. Every point in the code that needs to know the number of electrons or photons calls the singleton and asks it for those numbers. The singleton in turn accesses the pointer it owns and returns the requested values. The choice of which type of algorithm to use is made in the singleton constructor by querying the sim::LArG4Parameters service to ask it which the user wants. Currently there are two possible algorithms, the ISCalculationSeparate uses the algorithm that was previously in LArVoxelReadout to determine the number of ionization electrons and the algorithm from OpFastScintillation for scintillation photons. The changes to LArVoxelReadout and OpFastScintillation will come in a later commit. ISCalculationNEST uses the NestAlg to determine both. NestAlg is basically the code that currently resides in NestS1Light.

-   2013-08-15 Brian Rebel : redo the HitCheater so that it correctly handles the possibility of multiple geo::WireID objects for each channel. Now the algorithm first determines the geo::WireIDs for each channel. It then loops over the TDCIDEMap from the SimChannel and uses the actual location of the energy depositions to associated deposed charge with each geo::WireID as a function of TDC value. Finally, the TDC values for each WireID are examined to determine the locations of the hits.

This solves a problem with trying to use the ArgoNeuT neutrino files that were made before some change in the SQLite storage of the metadata. It also makes more sense for the user to have to explicitly tell a job to ignore its configuration in favor of a previously stored one.

This module will need some continued work before it is completely ready for prime-time, but is in a running and useable state
-   2013-05-30 Herbert Greenlee : Add ability to copy sam metadata attributes from input file to output file.

The photon sampling library built on the grid with scripts in PhotonPropagation/LibraryBuildTools is **necessary** for fast optical simulation, but is not being committed yet. So these are just preemptive.

-   2013-02-04 Brian Rebel : move the WireID implementation into the .cxx file as it now checks for a valid fWireID and then makes some calls to Geometry to try to determine the id if fWireID is not valid. Bump the class version number for geo::WireID in the classes\_def.xml file as well.
-   2013-02-04 Brian Rebel : add isValid field to WireID. Also add constructors to the struct where the default setting is for isValid to be false. If one uses the non-default ctor, then isValid is automatically set to true because one had to know all the fields to use that ctor.

This change has been vetted with the GeometryTest module as well as by generating new events and examining them in the EventDisplay. Also get rid of some assert(0) statements.
-   2013-01-21 Brian Rebel : fix unused variable warnings
-   2013-01-20 Brian Rebel : remove use of assert(0) in favor of cet::exception to control the program flow

This is bare bones right now, and just displays the dE/dx vs. range information stored in the Calorimetry objects (if they exist in input file), as well as the Chi2 information from the ParticleIdentification objects (if they exist in the file). Will beautify some more in the near future.

-   2012-07-03 Brian Rebel : So long SpacePointCollection, hello std::vector\< art::PtrVector\<recob::SpacePoint\> \>
-   2012-07-03 Brian Rebel : now storing std::vector\< art::PtrVector\<recob::SpacePoint\> \> directly into the event seems to be working. thanks to Chris Green for looking menacingly at the code so it would compile.

-   2012-07-02 Christie Chiu : added code in OpDetPulse to create PMT signal from photon arrival times
-   2012-07-02 Brian Rebel : changes to use art::Assns to get associations between data products. Also convert some art::PtrVector\<T\> to std::vector\< art::Ptr\<T\> \> as that provides a performance boost when one does not need to store the collection of art::Ptr\<T\> in the art::Event
-   2012-07-02 Brian Rebel : remove FindMany(P) and FindOne(P) methods from AssociationUtil. The reason to do that is the art::FindXXX objects are smart query objects and one takes a huge performance hit to make them multiple times rather than just once. Removing these methods allows users to instantiate the objects once for each query to be done at the cost of 1 more line of code. Lots of examples of how to do that now exist throughout the reconstruction and analysis code.

-   2012-07-02 Brian Rebel : Changes to remove data members of the form art::Ptr\<T\> or art::PtrVector\<T\>. Users should now make use of art::Assns instead through art::FindOne(P) and art::FindMany(P). Add SpacePointCollection class to hold a collection of art::PtrVector\<recob::SpacePoint\>; the purpose of this class is to provide a way to gather references to SpacePoints that have been determined to belong to a single topological collection. It may eventually turn into a typedef to art::PtrVector\<recob::SpacePoint\>. The SpacePointFinder module will produce a collection of these variables
-   2012-07-02 Brian Rebel : can now build dictionary for AnalysisBase defined data products
-   2012-06-30 David Mckee : An analysis module to be used in evaluation changes associated with improving magnetic field support. Compares MCTruth positions versus reconstructed positions (so far strictly by wire number, but evetually using SpacePoints which is why I choose TrackFinder).

-   2012-06-25 Brian Rebel : change Calorimetry module to make use of art::Assns between Tracks, SpacePoints and Hits. These changes have been shown to produce identicial results as the previous version of the code for a list of data and MC events specified by Kinga and Ornella. Also change several arrays that were allocated using the new command to be vectors. Remove input parameters from the configuration that are no longer necessary thanks to those changes.

-   2012-06-14 Brian Rebel : remove fChannelMap and related typedefs and rewrite Nchannels() method as fChannelMap was not really utilized anywhere else in the code and Nchannels didnt account for multiple cryostats properly. Changes were tested with the microboone geometry and shown to work as expected.

-   2012-06-11 Brian Rebel : make the value of fCurrentTrackID be the negative of the parent for the cases when either the particle falls under the tracking threshold or it is a secondary, tertiary, etc of an EM process and we are not keeping those particles. there is no change in the behavior when we do keep particles from those processes.
-   2012-06-09 Brian Rebel : change \#include statements to use the explicit files rather than sim.h everywhere. also add delineation between methods in several .cxx files

Quiet some compiler warnings as long as we are editing the code.
-   2012-05-17 Brian Rebel : add another CreateAssn function that takes 2 std::vectors for the objects to be associated rather than one std::vector and one art::PtrVector
-   2012-05-17 Brian Rebel : add code to prevent occassional orphaned track ids.
-   2012-05-16 Adam Patch : (now months old) macros to generate tree for root session manipulation of analysis histograms
-   2012-05-15 Andrzej Szelc : change the splines file used by genie to that used by NOVA, which provides more definitions and should solve the recent Genie crashes. The ToDo here is to find out is which definitions were missing and add them to the LArSpline file to conserve memory
-   2012-05-15 Andrzej Szelc : fix up microboone geometry some more. Redefine Vacuum as per NOVA definition, get the Air fractions to sum up to 1. Add option to define wires\_on in generate\_gdml as -w in the command line. Remove wires from the \_nowires.gdml as they were accidentally left there. Refine wire subtraction values to a nitpicky level. Regenerate .root file and .gdml file.
-   2012-05-15 Brian Rebel : back out accidental commits in r2636
-   2012-05-15 Brian Rebel : use the gdml file to create both the G4 geometry and the ROOT TGeoManager as ROOT v5.30.06 can once again interpret gdml in batch mode. Leave the hooks for separate variables for the ROOT and GDML file names in just in case the interpreter breaks again. In this case, think of the fROOTFile as holding the name of the file used to make the ROOT TGeoManager. This change still allows the G4 geometry to be specified without wires.
-   2012-05-15 Herbert Greenlee : Fix bug exposed by geometry change.
-   2012-05-15 Herbert Greenlee : Tweaks for Hit Kalman filter.

-   2012-04-26 Brian Rebel : attempt to avoid recasting of a size\_t to an int was thwarted by original test on that variable being \>=0 in an decrementing loop - if you subtract 1 from size\_t = 0 it becomes a very large positive value. add todo flag to fix up that logic at some point.
-   2012-04-25 Brian Rebel : updates to account for the changes to the EndPoint2D constructor.
-   2012-04-25 Andrzej Szelc : add the saving of energy to the IDE objects in a way that piggy backs on the numelectrons saving. There may be a more efficient way to do this

-   2012-04-23 Brian Rebel : make it possible to associate hits to the produced clusters without having to get them from the clusters…ie get ready for when the art::PtrVectors are no longer owned by data products. also remove a test on plane number = 0 to decide if a plane is an induction plane and instead use geo::kInduction and geo::SigType\_t.
-   2012-04-23 Kinga Partyka : getting track length in 3 different ways, other changes to structure of Ttree
-   2012-04-23 Herbert Greenlee : Really save space points directly in event.

-   2012-04-22 Brian Rebel : forgot this one too. ugh.
-   2012-04-22 Brian Rebel : remove statements like if(plane==0) in favor of if(sigType == geo::kInduction) to make the code more detector agnostic. also make a data member of the service handle to the geometry rather than getting it all the time. comment out code that is in an if statement that tests on art::Event::isRealData as those types of tests should **never** be in reconstruction code to avoid introducing data/MC discrepancies that are very hard to track down. switch std::cout to mf::LogInfo to conform to coding conventions. mark lots of magic numbers with /// \\todo tags to indicate they need to be examined and made into parameters or commented. lots of ancilliary formatting fixes. no algorithm changes have been introduced.
-   2012-04-22 Brian Rebel : these changes didnt get committed yesterday with other geometry changes
-   2012-04-22 Eric Church : updates
-   2012-04-21 Brian Rebel : add arguments to PositionToCryostat and PositionToTPC methods that are unsigned int references to the logical cryostat and tpc numbers so that information is also provided by the methods. Useful in LArVoxelReadout::DriftIonizationElectrons where one then wants to use the NearestChannel method
-   2012-04-21 Brian Rebel : fix multiple include of FindManyP.h, return type for FindOne.
-   2012-04-21 Brian Rebel : add version of FindOne to return const reference to desired object. Also add methods to return collections of objects of type X that are not associated with objects of type Y, both std::vector\<const \*\> and art::PtrVector forms for the return.
-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : one more configuration file change…hopefully the last for a while. SeedFinder-\>SeedConfig for configuration of SeedFinder module

-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : adapt to renamed hitfindermodules.fcl
-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : remove fftfinder(ana).fcl in favor of more consistently named hitfindermodules.fcl file. Note any private job files that make use of the removed files will need to change fftfinder(ana).fcl to hitfindermodules.fcl in the includes. standard\_reco.fcl will be updated now.
-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : move track cheater configuration into trackfindermodules.fcl. make gratuitous use of @local:: syntax in fcl files rather than repeating the same lines 3 times for each experiment. move the seed configuration into a new parameter set so that SeedFinder and BezierTracker dont have to repeat the same quantities in their configurations and can use the new seed configuration parameter set.
-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : move shower cheater module configuration into showerfindermodules.fcl
-   2012-04-20 Brian Rebel : move configuration of cluster cheater module into clustermodules.fcl

-   2012-04-19 Brian Rebel : make dummy variable to quiet compiler warnings about unused variables…so annoying.
-   2012-04-19 Brian Rebel : update for the interface change to the recob::Track ctor
-   2012-04-18 Brian Rebel : add static types to hold obviously bogus values. folks should use these as defaults for numbers that may not get filled so as to alert downstream users that what is contained by the variable is not legit.
-   2012-04-18 Brian Rebel : add methods to access the first and last members of each stored vector, ie vertex and end values. also add data member to hold the fit momentum for vertex and end positions at least, so default is to make a vector of length 2 filled with util::kBogusD. add data member to return the length of the track based on the distances between the points held in fXYZ. add method to access the dQdx information.
-   2012-04-18 Andrzej Szelc : Remove spurious line.
-   2012-04-18 Andrzej Szelc : modify LArVoxelReadout so that it picks up the LArProperties values at the beginning of an event instead of in the constructor which was indirectly launched by the BeginJob() of LArG4. Promote services to data members of LArVoxelReadout in the process.
-   2012-04-18 Andrzej Szelc : Introduce a flag that checks if the values read out from LArProperties have already been extracted from the DB. If not, the behaviour of the code can be to throw an exception or display a warning. For the time being setting thee warning option for all three experiments. Some code cleanup.
-   2012-04-18 Brian Rebel : remove extraneous “;”
-   2012-04-18 Brian Rebel : changes to persistent Track object decided at tracking meeting today. Remove fState datamember, add method to return size of dQdx vector, make dQdx vector default to a vector with 0 entries if not supplied in the constructor. Add some comments.

-   2012-04-17 Brian Rebel : change ordering of View\_t enumerations so that the 0th is an actual view to make ordering of vectors based on these views easier.
-   2012-04-17 Brian Rebel : remove include for BezierTrackBase from list as it is removed from the repository. This will fix the overnight build failure.
-   2012-04-17 Benjamin Jones : Update to DetectorProperties methods as recommended by Herb
-   2012-04-16 Benjamin Jones : Fix dumb mistake - oops
-   2012-04-16 Benjamin Jones : Say goodbye to BezierTrackBase
-   2012-04-16 Benjamin Jones : Move to revamped track base class
-   2012-04-16 Andrzej Szelc : If the database is swamped with connections the service will wait incremental periods of time up to 20 seconds trying to reconnect. Plus some changes in the output messages.
-   2012-04-16 Benjamin Jones : Data members made protected, so derived classes have access
-   2012-04-16 Benjamin Jones : Remove seedfinders reliance on 2D clusters - can now feed with plain hits instead
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : add methods to track to get the number of trajectory points (position and direction pairs) and covariance and state pairs from the object. Also add method to return a trajectory point. Add lines to classes\_def.xml and classes.h to prepare for making associations between Tracks and SpacePoints and Hits and SpacePoints.
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : add doxygen friendly commentting
-   2012-04-15 Eric Church : post-merge sanity check (in)
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : make Track3Dreco also produce art::Assns of Tracks to Clusters and Tracks to Hits.
-   2012-04-15 Eric Church : Return to situation in which dQdx is not forced to have same size as dir and pos. This is intentional. It is possible, not incumbent, that Track algorithms will also do dQdx calculation. More desirable way to do this is to default the dQdx arguments to something, but that appears impossible. Don’t bump class version \#.
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : add code to create art::Assns between Showers and Clusters and Showers and Hits. Also clean up code to use the message facility rather than std::cout. Add some doxygen \\todo flags to various places that assume single cryostat and single tpc geometries. Other changes to make the formatting of the code easier to read.
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : add creation of art::Assns between Prongs or Tracks and the Hits they correspond to. Also add \\todo flags to Track3DKalmanSPS indicating that art::Event::isRealData should never be called in reconstruction algorithms as that introduces the potential for data/MC discrepancies. All such code should be removed ASAP. Remove test on whether the std::vector\<recob::Track\> produced in Track3DKalmanSPS has any entries before putting it into the event as even if none were made an empty collection would still have to be put in the event as the module says it is making one - ART would complain by design otherwise.
-   2012-04-15 Brian Rebel : add std::vector\<TVector3\>, std::vector\<TMatrixD\>, and std::vector\< std::vector\<double\> \> to the dictionary generating classes\_def.xml. Also add comments to the Track.h file to explain what each data member represents. Change TMatrixT\<double\> to TMatrixD everywhere to reduce the amount of typing that people have to do. Update the tests of the input vector sizes in the constructors to explicitly state which vectors are the problem. Also check that the dQdx and position vectors are the same size. Add includes for TMatrixD and TVector3 to the .h file to make sure they are explicitly there, must have been pulled in from somewhere, who knows where. Increment Track ClassVersion with the changes that were made. Update the \<\< operator to reflect the information that is currently in Track.

-   2012-04-05 Brian Rebel : use geo::SignalType\_t to key the area normalization array rather than plane number as the latter does not work for experiments with more than 2 planes. Also remove call to evt.isRealData as reconstruction should never have those sorts of calls in the algorithms. The same functionality is recovered by having different parameter sets for data and MC. Still not sure why they are different, but this way the difference is up front in a fcl file and not buried in the code where it may not be easily found.
-   2012-04-05 Brian Rebel : remove references to old cluster services.
-   2012-04-05 Brian Rebel : make use of HoughLineAlg
-   2012-04-05 Brian Rebel : change Service code that performed algorithms (ie EndPointService, DBScanService, HoughLineService) to no longer be services. Instead, they are simply objects, denoted with the suffix Alg in their names to indicate they encapsulate an algorithm. These objects are still configurable by requiring the modules calling them own a local copy and pass the relevant fcl parameter set into the object constructor or reconfigure method. clusterservices.fcl has been renamed to clusteralgorithms.fcl and all \_service.cc files have been removed. The clustermodules.fcl file has been updated to account for the changes. A test job with these changes ran to completion. No changes to the algorithm code has been made.

-   2012-03-07 Eric Church : Revert to 2296
-   2012-03-06 Brian Rebel : cause a thrown exception when the input vector size is different from fPDG or 1 and padding out is desired. that flags the case where it is unclear what the user intended.
-   2012-03-06 Brian Rebel : add some more comments to the PadVector method. Also acknowledge that fPDG is the vector we care about and remove the maxSize input in favor of just using fPDG.size(). Finally, ensure that it always causes an exception if the pad out vector option is not chosen and the vector in question is not the same size as fPDG….even if it is bigger because we dont know what the user intention was.
-   2012-03-06 Eric Church : Add a fcl script for compression-mode running.
-   2012-03-06 Andrzej Szelc : do not throw exception if PDG.size()==1.
-   2012-03-06 Eric Church : Changes to make Compression mode work. See corresponding ../EventGenerator/prodsingle\_uboone\_comp.fcl
-   2012-03-05 Brian Rebel : make the association of hits to the super cluster work in LineMerger. Previously only the hits from the seed cluster were added, now all hits from participating clusters in a super cluster should be added. Also make the code easier to read.
-   2012-03-05 Andrzej Szelc : add normalization of the electronics response function for uBooNE
-   2012-03-05 Brian Rebel : fix formatting of messages about padding out vectors and bad vector sizes
-   2012-03-05 Eric Church : Make fPadOutVectors of consistent types.
-   2012-03-05 Brian Rebel : remove presorting of super clusters before putting the collection into the event. downstream modules should not depend on the sorting of these clusters.
-   2012-03-02 Eric Church : (1) Go some way toward detector acgnostification in SpacePts. Much left to do. (2) Introduce Associations in SpacePoint\* classes.
-   2012-03-02 Brian Rebel : remove dependency of SummaryData on Geometry library as the only dependency is on the DetId enumerated type from Geometry.h
-   2012-03-01 Brian Rebel : change fPadVectors from int to a bool, also read it in with the reconfigure method. Make some changes to the printVecs method to make it a little easier to parse for people reading the code. also condense the check on a vector size into a method to make that section of the code a little easier to read.
-   2012-03-01 Andrzej Szelc : remove unneeded extra variable
-   2012-03-01 Andrzej Szelc : Flesh out the single generation for when configuration parameters are specified in a vector. If the size is one (default) the vectors will be padded to the size of the PDG vector. If larger \>1 but \< PDG.size() an exception will be thrown. In case of multiple configuration settings the used versions will be printed out. Also, change .fcl files to not pickup the ArgoNeut beam setting for microboone

That is now carefully done. User must hand-prescribe the PDG and P0 vectors at the minimum. {Finally, note to the fastidious: couts are coded here over mf::warnings in places for ease of printing out vectors.}
-   2012-02-28 Brian Rebel : define associations in both directions to make all aspects of the system happy
-   2012-02-28 Brian Rebel : make use of associations of simb::MCTruth to sim::Particle to do the back tracking, also remove error message about it not working as it now does.

-   2012-02-28 Benjamin Jones : cleaning up a minor commit mishap
-   2012-02-28 Benjamin Jones : First commit of SeedFinder. Not for public consumption yet.
-   2012-02-27 Brian Rebel : add new UserAction, G4BadIdeaAction, to hold code that grabs const pointers from G4 and then tries to change them. That code is removed from ParticleListAction and moved into this new UserAction. The new action warns users when it starts up that it is there and why it is there, which should remind us to take it out once we switch to the new version of G4 (\>4.9.4.p02). Also remove test to kill tracks that leave the world volume as that issue is indicative of a real problem that needs to be solved. The test also effectively stopped cosmic ray event generation.
-   2012-02-27 Eric Church : Kill the secondaries too when it steps outside the volume.
-   2012-02-27 Eric Church : Insert protection against tracks in outer space…

The DatabaseUtil will apparently not work on condor jobs yet, also due to an ART bug LArProperties may not be initialized early enough. These issues will be solved ASAP, in the meantime contact me if you want to run jobs using electronlifetime
-   2012-02-23 Brian Rebel : remove hardcoded but commented out include path to postgresql at fnal.

-   2012-02-21 Brian Rebel : make it possible to draw truth vectors for art::Events with more than one simb::MCTruth object
-   2012-02-21 Brian Rebel : changes necessary to be able to overlay events from multiple MC generators, ie CRY and GENIE. Add methods to LArVoxelReadout to keep the ionization electrons from multiple MCTruth lists around through an entire art::Event rather than reseting the collection for each one.
-   2012-02-21 Saima Farooq : update the T962 GNUmakefile (in order to incorporate the recent changes: deletion of Calorimetry package and addition of CCRecoEffTree in T962)

-   2012-02-20 Brian Rebel : remove unused histograms and add histograms to count the number of photons, electrons and muons in each window that pass through the cryostat. Add test to ensure that at least 1 particle passes through the cryostat for each time window. Only pass those particles that go through the cryostat, ie have a closest approach to the center of the cryostat that is within it, on to Geant4.
-   2012-02-20 Brian Rebel : add new method to Geometry Ncryostats as a place holder for when the LBNE geometry is updated. Also add cryostat number argument to CryostatBoundaries to specify which cryostat is desired, not currently used.

-   2012-01-13 Brian Rebel : Add method to LArProperties service to return the density of the LAr based on the temperature. For now if the temperature is less than 100K it returns a constant 1.43 g/cm\^3 and 1.449e-3 g/cm\^3 (ie density of argon gas) otherwise. Fix the larparameters.fcl set for the MicroBooNE lifetime to be 3 ms rather than 1e8 ms. Add new utility class to make art::Assns objects to provide inter-product referencing functionality.
-   2012-01-12 Kinga Partyka : minor change of values

-   2012-01-04 Herbert Greenlee : Add SpacePointFinder and SpacePointCheater modules.
-   2012-01-04 Herbert Greenlee : Remove fcl parameter and attribute UseMC from SpacePointService. Calling programs can still build space points using mc truth by calling a different public method.
-   2012-01-03 Herbert Greenlee : Fix the normalization of the deconvolution kernel dynamically (make it independent of the normalization of the filter function), such that peak of response = peak of deconvoluted response.
-   2011-12-31 Brian Rebel : bump the ART version to v1.00.06. see [https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/art/wiki\#ART-Suite-release-notes](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/art/wiki#ART-Suite-release-notes) for information on what changed between v1.00.02 and 1.00.06.

-   2011-12-12 Brian Rebel : a minor change to the previous commit
-   2011-12-12 Brian Rebel : looks like the non-debug build has not worked since the setup script made debug the default build. change the nightly build script to account for the change.
-   2011-12-12 Kinga Partyka : catching NearestChannel exception, further improvements to the TTree
-   2011-12-12 Kinga Partyka : taking out MC dependency when making clusters-that was not used anyway. Cleaning up and making better TTree for analysis
-   2011-12-12 Brian Rebel : make the method to draw the EndPoint2D objects not need to use Hits to draw. Should probably give EndPoint2D a method to return which TPC it is in.
-   2011-12-12 Herbert Greenlee : Add SignalShapingServiceMicroBooNE.
-   2011-12-12 Brian Rebel : changes to allow generation of hand scan files with vertices throughout the volume.
-   2011-12-11 Brian Rebel : clean up the code by switching to using the MessageLogger consistently and attempting to remove lots of ArgoNeuT specific calculations in favor of using information from DetectorProperties and LArProperties services. Still one instance of ArgoNeuT specific calculation in HarrisVertexFinder, flagged with \\todo for doxygen
-   2011-12-11 Brian Rebel : lots of clean up of the EndPointService and EndPointModule code, including removing some ArgoNeuT specific hard coded numbers.
-   2011-12-11 Brian Rebel : remove view arguments for Hits() and Charge() methods as EndPoint2D can only have hits associated with one view by definition
-   2011-12-11 Brian Rebel : make it possible to draw EndPoint2D objects
-   2011-12-09 Brian Rebel : put back the channumber calculation and stuffing of it into the exception message
-   2011-12-09 Brian Rebel : change exception messages to no longer claim that UINT\_MAX will be returned as throwing an exception prevents one from returning anything. change the strings in the exceptions and messages to all be Geometry in order to make more efficient use of the message service ability to turn off messages if so desired.
-   2011-12-08 Adam Patch : flag and loop added to catch meaningful events
-   2011-12-08 Brian Rebel : put the art::FindMany in Cluster2D method in a try/catch block

-   2011-11-28 Adam Patch : expanded TPC, adjusted size of world volume, fix to geo script
-   2011-11-28 Brian Page : Change default FFTW planning flag to P. This introduces a small startup penalty(\~0.5s) but makes transforms roughly 10% faster.
-   2011-11-27 Andrzej Szelc : return to exception throwing in geo::NearestChannel that should solve the evd crashes in a cleaner way, since it is being caught in SimulationDrawer

-   2011-11-27 Brian Rebel : remove MagField as its functionality is now in the nutools MagneticField package
-   2011-11-23 Andrzej Szelc : put in a fix, so that Simulation MCTruth vectors that arrive at the edge of the chamber don’t cause a crash of the event display. The Nearest Channel Method now returns 0 or max-channel number in case the calculation goes out of bounds and does not throw an exception.
-   2011-11-22 Brian Rebel : return the TGeoNode::Name() rather than the TGeoVolume::Name() in Geometry::VolumeName() as the former provides a unique identifier for that instance of the requested volume
-   2011-11-22 Eric Church : Until multi-cryo, multi-TPC code is robust, this geometry is nice to have.
-   2011-11-21 Brian Rebel : make warning message about using default constructors more user friendly by giving an indication about when using the default ctors is expected. keep the message in place to remind people to not use default ctors when making data products to store in the event. also give the messages a common label in the message facility so that they can be quieted if desired.
-   2011-11-20 Brian Rebel : add data members to hold the Clusters view and total charge in preparation for moving to a system where Clusters are associated with their constituent hits and dont own them. For now, return the view and charge information based on the owned collection of hits. Backwards compatibility is preserved. Will have to alter the signature of the constructor when we move to just using the Assns. These changes have been tested to ensure backwards compatibility.
-   2011-11-20 Brian Rebel : clean up the RecoBaseDrawer code for several types of objects, including Clusters, Prongs, Vertices, and Events. Make use of the Hit() method in each of those to just call Hit2D when appropriate. Also make changes in anticipation of using art::Associations in the future. Direct use of Assns through FindMany objects is currently commented out. These changes have been tested and shown to work.

-   2011-11-18 Eric Church : Need starting line as Info, not Debug.
-   2011-11-18 Brian Rebel : remove initialization list from LArProperties constructor (again) because that is now handled by the reconfigure method. make use of @local syntax for the fcl file.
-   2011-11-18 Eric Church : Take DriftTheElectrons out and avail of already existing \\!DisableWireplanes in sim::LArG4Parameters

-   2011-11-17 Brian Rebel : remove the art::Ptr\<simb::MCTruth\> as a data member of sim::Particle. Make associations between the particles put into the event and the simb::MCTruth instead. No code was using that data member or associated methods except EventFinder/EventCheater.cxx anyway.
-   2011-11-17 Brian Rebel : improve the functioning of the HitCheater by making direct use of the number of electrons deposited per TDC from the SimChannels and converting that value to ADC through the use of DetectorProperties::ElectronsToADC. This avoids having to deal with bipolar pulses for induction planes.
-   2011-11-17 Brian Page : Give microboone smaller values for minimum width to fix missing hit issue.
-   2011-11-17 Adam Patch : addition of center rock + correction to placement of A/CPAs inside of cryostats

-   2011-11-15 David Mckee : DBcluster had a dependency on the implementation of DBScanService that was causing Method=3 (the new clustering algorithm) to break. This commit brings all three methods into alignment, but **leaves the dependency**.
-   2011-11-15 David Mckee : More changes to the logging priorities, and a minor defnesive test added to run\_dbscan\_cluster.
-   2011-11-15 Brian Rebel : add in some missing quotes
-   2011-11-15 Brian Rebel : dont try to delete the fActiveVolume as it was never **newed**. This change makes it possible to use the lbnebulky geometry.
-   2011-11-14 David Mckee : Downgrade the severity of various informative output.
-   2011-11-14 David Mckee : Fix a fencepost error with initializaing fBadWireSum, and gaurd against access errors to the same in AcceptFindNeignbor
-   2011-11-14 Brian Page : Fix bug in the calculation of signal area for multi-hits.
-   2011-11-14 Eric Church : Add -opportunistic to submit scripts to pick up extra, idle grid nodes. Rumor in gridland is that this could have a big effect in getting extra cycles.
-   2011-11-13 David Mckee : ::Boggle:: The RStarTree has been storing positions as integers all along. This would certainly make it impossible to match the findNeighbors metric. Patched to use doubles.
-   2011-11-13 David Mckee : Changes to the \#include file management to be more consistent with the rest of LArSoft. Should not affect function
-   2011-11-13 Brian Rebel : remove Print() methods in favor of only having \<\< operators

-   2011-11-11 Brian Rebel : quiet set but not used complier warning
-   2011-11-11 Brian Rebel : use the process string to determine if a particle is a primary one or not. this is in anticipation of eventually using art::Assns to associate sim::Particles to simb::MCTruth objects and removing the Primary() method and fprimary data member from sim::Particle.
-   2011-11-11 Brian Rebel : comment out kc and khbar until they are needed in order to quiet compiler warnings

-   2011-11-10 Brian Rebel : add method to TPCGeo to return the drift distance for the TPC.
-   2011-11-10 Brian Rebel : make SimWireMicroBooNE get the number of time samples from the DetectorProperties service. Also change std::cout and std::cerr to us the MessageLogger instead. Truncate the number of entries in the produced ADC vector to be the number of time samples before filling the RawDigit.
-   2011-11-10 Brian Rebel : add number of time samples for a readout frame to the DetectorProperties service, set to 2048 for ArgoNeuT, 3200 for uB/LBNE

-   2011-11-09 Brian Page : Oops, try again.
-   2011-11-09 Brian Page : Initial import of code to generate response functions for deconvolution of Microboone data.
-   2011-11-09 Andrzej Szelc : switch recontruction autozoom to digits instead of hits
-   2011-11-09 David Mckee : Bring the KSU setup script up to date
-   2011-11-09 Brian Rebel : add ability to select type of build when sourcing the setup script. for now the default is debug, so that every one setting up at FNAL will get the debug build. this build does not hamper performance for users working interactively. those wishing a non-debug build will have the option of a profile build called prof as soon as it is available from the cet group.
-   2011-11-09 Brian Rebel : remove the Old from ChannelToWire calls
-   2011-11-09 Brian Rebel : make the new ChannelToPlaneWire also return const WireGeo& like the old one instead of a void
-   2011-11-09 Eric Church : Signature change on ChannelToWire out from under us. Use ChannelToWireOld for now to allow the build. Defer intended use of new ChannelToWire to author of signature change or this code itself

-   2011-11-08 Brian Rebel : add new HitCheater to make hits from the MCTruth information. The hits wont line up exactly in the event display with the signals from the recob::Wire objects. The deconvolution seems to shift the peak time of the signals to be earlier than the raw data would seem to indicate. These hits should be good enough for now. This module should allow people trying to work on MicroBooNE reconstruction to make progress until the electronics simulation for MicroBooNE is sorted out.
-   2011-11-08 Brian Rebel : format the output of the Hit \<\< operator
-   2011-11-07 Brian Rebel : protect against there not being a neutrino in the MCTruth for the case of single particle or cosmic ray files
-   2011-11-06 Saima Farooq : avoiding conflict: analysis should read those track that are used in track matching with MINOS, (if wish to use tracks from spacepts, replace ‘track3d’ by ‘spacepts’ in analysistreemodule.fcl AND in matchtracksmodule.fcl both

-   2011-11-04 Brian Rebel : keep backing out the SimListUtils as service
-   2011-11-04 Brian Rebel : Change SimListUtils back to **not** being a service. Having it as a service caused problems in jobs where both the LArG4 and LArG4Ana modules were run. The issue is that as a service it was unable to grab the simulation produced objects in the preEvent processing as they were not yet made.
-   2011-11-03 Brian Rebel : remove superfluous line

-   2011-11-02 Brian Rebel : turn the SimListUtils services back on in the simulation\_services parameter sets as the previous commit to SimListUtils fixes the problem that was keeping people from running jobs.
-   2011-11-02 Brian Rebel : check that the art::Handle\< std::vector\<sim::Particle\> \> was successfully found in this event, simply return if it wasnt as that means we cant fill a particle list, etc
-   2011-11-02 Kinga Partyka : adding more info to branches
-   2011-11-02 Mitchell Soderberg : Initial commit of ArgoNeuT-specific EventDisplay, which builds on top of LArSoft EventDisplay. The main purpose of this display is to draw a 3D version of ArgoNeuT+MINOS and show tracks reconstructed in both. Tracks in ArgoNeuT that are matched to negatively(positively) charged MINOS tracks are drawn with blue(red) markers, and the MINOS tracks as blue(red) lines. Unmatched negative(positive) MINOS tracks are drawn as unconnected blue(red) markers. Unmatched ArgoNeuT tracks are drawn as green markers.
