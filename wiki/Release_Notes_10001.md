LArSoft 1.00.01
----------------------------------

### Purpose

First production release of LArSoft suite under git / mrb / ups. Based on a snapshot of svn taken on \
21-Jan-2014 after the svn repository was closed to public writes, plus one bug fix (in \
larsim/LArG4/LArG4/IonizationAndScintillation\*) that was subsquently ported into svn. The svn-based\
release S2014.01.24 should be identical to the code in this release.

### New features

None relative to S2014.01.24

### Bug fixes

None relative to S2014.01.24

### Known issues

In larpandora: an include path in larpandora/pandoraservices.fcl has an error. Building a local copy of larpandora against larsoft v1.00.01 fixes it.
