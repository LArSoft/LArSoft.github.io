h1. Debugging with cppcheck 

<pre>
7/19/16 update: setup cppcheck v1_58
does not work:
ERROR: Product &#39;cppcheck&#39; (with qualifiers &#39;&#39;), has no v1_58 version (or may not exist)

so tried: ups list -aK+ cppcheck
and the list is empty.

Checking your code for non-compile time errors with cppcheck.

cppcheck is a very handy tool available for checking your code that gcc can&#39;t catch like array out of bound error and can also be used for optimization.  The tool is documented "here.":http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppcheck/index.php?title=Main_Page

It is setup at Fermilab using ups.  To do so you can

<pre>
setup cppcheck v1_58
</pre>

You then test the code in directory MyDir by doing

<pre>
cppcheck --enable=style MyDir
</pre>

It will print out details for optimizing or fixing your code.
