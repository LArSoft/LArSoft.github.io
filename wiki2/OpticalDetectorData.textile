h1. OpticalDetectorData

This contains data classes associated with simulating the ADCs and FEM (Front-End Modules) associated with the optical detectors (PMTs). There&#39;s a little more information on the [[optical simulations]] page. 

As of June 2013, the classes in this package tend to be MicroBooNE-specific.
