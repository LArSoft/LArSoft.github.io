h2. Requirements

The following information must be included as "Doxygen":http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html formatted text in every header or module file.

* Introduction / motivation / overview of what the code does 
* Input data
* Output data
* Configuration data / classes / services used (directly)
* Algorithm description (Can be reference to "larsoft.org":http://larsoft.org/list entry)
* Assumptions, pre-requisites
* Limitations
* References
* institution and experiment of author/contributor(s)

h2. Guidelines

Each major algorithm should have an entry in http://larsoft.org/list. (Do this by https://larsoft.org/add )

Every file should have inline comments at sufficient frequency to allow readers unfamiliar with the code to be able to read and understand the code without undue effort. These comments should not be "Doxygen":http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html formatted.

Each major algorithm should have a tech note describing technical details of the algorithm (can be internal to LArSoft community or published such as in http://techpubs.fnal.gov/
