h2. Purpose

* changes in develop
* approved PRs

h2. New features

* larpandoracontent PR 17
** In this PR we create a new member variable m_daughterVolumeId in the LArCaloHit class such that we know the daughter volume ID of each hit. There is now 1 daughter volume per CRP (see associated LArPandora PR). This ensures that 2D clusters coming from different CRPs can&#39;t be matched together. This check is now performed in the view-matching algorithms and works as follows: we look at the intersection between the list of daughter volumes of each cluster, if the intersection is empty the match cannot happen.
** To avoid compatibility issues with older reconstructed data we introduce a new XML parameter in the LArMaster block. One needs to have <LArCaloHitVersion>2</LArCaloHitVersion> to enable this functionality. If it does not appear in the file, the behaviour is left unchanged.
** This PR is related to larpandora PR 15 , which reads in the daughter volumes.
* larpandora PR 15
** This PR concerns the creation of daughter volumes for each CRP in the Dual-Phase geometry along with a more complete set of member variables for the LArDaughterVolume class. Also the new LArCaloHit member variable m_daughterVolumeId gets filled with the daughter volume ID of the corresponding hit.
** This PR is associated to the larpandoracontent PR 17 in which cluster matching checks for a common daughter volume, where this is relevant (dual phase).
* lardataobj PR 11
** Added ROOT dictionary for std::vector<art::Ptr<recob::Cluster>>. 
** For storage of selected clusters, I require std::vector<art::Ptr<recob::Cluster>>.  This request will enable the creation of the ROOT dictionaries needed to serialise such data structure.
** Why not the already supported art::PtrVector<recob::Cluster>? My use case allows cluster objects to come from different data products, and it is my understanding that all the elements of a art::PtrVector must belong to the same one.
** Why not in the experiment repository?  The class does not depend on anything specific to the experiment, so lardataobj is its natural place.  In addition, this strategy avoids conflicts by "preventing" the same definition from appearing in different repositories.
* lardata PR 13
** Allow range-for loop on associated_groups_with_left() output 
** Including a C++17-aware unit test.
* larrecodnn PR 14
** Add a separate label for SimChannel. This is needed for ProtoDUNE refactored simulation. The changes were made by Leigh Whitehead. 

h2. Bug fixes

* larreco PR 26
** Including missing configuration in clustermodules.fcl 
** One of the configurations therein requires standard_cchitfinderalg, defined larreco/RecoAlg/hitalgorithms.fcl.  Without including it, clustermodules.fcl can&#39;t be used stand-alone.
** This pull request is based on the assumption that it should be possible to include clustermodules.fcl in a configuration file without explicitly including anything more.
* webevd PR 18
** Fix a few glitches due to residual hardcoded view numbers
** Fix a few glitches with axis labels due to residual hardcoded view numbers which have been wrong since VD support was added.
