h1. Manually trigger a CI test

Whenever possible, it is best to use the github trigger build option.  However, when a PR needs to be tested along with a feature branch in experiment code, the CI must be triggered manually.

h2(count).  Trigger a CI build with experiment feature branches

the trigger option that handles LArSoft PRs and feature branches from experiment code is --revisions,
a command example would look like:
<pre>
trigger --build-delay 0 --cert ${CI_CERT} --version develop --workflow default_wf --revisions
"LArSoft/larreco#5,LArSoft/larcore#3,dunetpc@feature/bla1,uboonecode@feature/something1,ubreco@feature/something2"

(the field separator can be either space or comma)
</pre>

the options _--version develop_ and _--workflow default_wf_ in this example are using the default values.

To get the cert, it is enough to run the _kx509_ command, then the cert path can be provided to the option _--cert_ or pointed through an environment variable.

Eventually the trigger command can include the option to select the platform (slf6, slf7, both if omitted)
<pre>
--force-platform slf7
</pre>
and to select qualifiers
<pre>
--quals e19:py2:prof (this is the default, for the slf7 the &#39;py2&#39; is automatically removed from the qualifier)
</pre>

h3(count).  example

The certificate is generated in /tmp
<pre>
$ kx509
Authorizing ...... authorized
Fetching certificate ..... fetched
Storing certificate in /tmp/x509up_u1147
Your certificate is valid until: Wed Feb 26 12:58:18 2020
</pre>

Get the environment:
<pre>
source /cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/products/common/etc/setups.sh
setup lar_ci
</pre>

Trigger a build:
<pre>
$ trigger --build-delay 0 --cert /tmp/x509up_u1147 --version develop --workflow default_wf --revisions "LArSoft/larsoft#8 LArSoft/larsim#6 dunetpc@feature/lg_LegacyLArG4"
Checking if /tmp/x509up_u1147 can be reused ... yes
