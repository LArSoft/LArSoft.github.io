h2. larpandora v03_04_00

* 2014-12-02  Lynn Garren : larpandora v03_04_00 for larsoft v03_04_04
* 2014-12-02  Lynn Garren : Merge branch &#39;feature/blake_particleSeeds&#39; into release/v03_04_04
* 2014-11-27  Andrew Blake : Merge branch &#39;feature/blake_updateForLBNE&#39; into develop. This will remove the LBNE-specific .fcl and .xml files (which are being moved to lbnecode). I have also modified PFParticleTrackMaker to write out ART associations between tracks and hits, and to store better positions and directions in the recob::Track objects.
* 2014-11-27  Andrew Blake : Remove PandoraSettings_LBNE35t_Cosmic settings from scripts and move to lbnecode
* 2014-11-27  Andrew Blake : Remove the obsolete dependency on BackTracker service in CMakeLists
* 2014-11-27  Andrew Blake : Move LBNE .fcl files to lbnecode
* 2014-11-27  Andrew Blake : Modifying PFParticleTrackMaker Producer to write out ART associations between recob::Track and recob::Hit objects (as this seems to be the standard). Also adding directions to the trajectory points along the recob::Track objects (based on a simple linear fit, so more work to do here).
* 2014-11-22  Andrew Blake : Writing out recob::Seeds and their associations to recob::PFParticles

h2. larana v03_03_04

* 2014-12-03  Lynn Garren : larana v03_03_04 for larsoft v03_04_04
