h1. How to tag and build a LArSoft vx_yy_zz release

{{>TOC}}

Builds are made with Jenkins, and tagging is done on a local development machine.  The instructions presume that the local development machine has products installed in /products.  If the products are installed elsewhere, use that directory.

We are using a procedure that mimics git flow instead of using it directly.

Guiding philosophy: the code should build consistently before the tagging process starts.  This means that we make a test build first and commit fixes to develop if necessary.   We are also now running the quick CI tests locally.
