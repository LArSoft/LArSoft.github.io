h2. larsim v04_07_00

* 2015-05-12  Lynn Garren : larsim v04_07_00 for larsoft v04_08_00
* 2015-05-12  Lynn Garren : Merge branch &#39;feature/brebel_AuxDetSensitive&#39; into release/v04_08_00
* 2015-04-24  Brian_Rebel : Changes to account for the use of AuxDetSensitiveGeo.  AuxDetReadoutGeometry now first tries to find volumes with Sensitive in their name in the gdml file, and if it does not find any it defaults to looking for AuxDet volumes.  AuxDetReadout now has a data member to keep track of which sensitive volume in an AuxDet that it correponds too.  The sensitive volume is now part of the name used to describe the sensitive volume to G4.  AuxDetSimChannel now knows what sensitive volume it corresponds to as well.  Make it possible for old code to still work by providing defaults for the sensitive volume value in the methods that now take that parameter.

* 2015-05-12  Lynn Garren : lardata v04_06_01 for larsoft v04_08_00

h2. larcore v04_07_00

* 2015-05-12  Lynn Garren : larcore v04_07_00 for larsoft v04_08_00
* 2015-05-12  Brian_Rebel : fixes to make it all compile
* 2015-05-12  Brian_Rebel : Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; into feature/brebel_AuxDetSensitive
* 2015-05-12  Brian_Rebel : add methods to ChannelMapAlg to find closest aux det and aux det sensitive, call those from Geometry
* 2015-04-24  Brian_Rebel : Add new geometry object, AuxDetSensitiveGeo, to describe the sensitive volume(s) of an auxiliary detector.  AuxDetGeo now owns a vector of these new objects.  For .gdml files made before this addition, the full AuxDet volume will be copied into a single AuxDetSensitiveGeo for that detector.  Add methods to Geometry to access these new volumes.  Add methods to GeoObjectSorter to sort them, and to ChannelMapStandardAlg to be able to sort them.
