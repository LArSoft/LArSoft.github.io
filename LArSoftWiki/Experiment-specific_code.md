[OBSOLETE Code moved from core LArSoft to lbnecode](OBSOLETE_Code_moved_from_core_LArSoft_to_lbnecode) (`lbnecode` was migrated to dunetpc on Aug. 16, 2015)  
[OBSOLETE Code moved from core LArSoft to uboonecode](OBSOLETE_Code_moved_from_core_LArSoft_to_uboonecode)

Note that all files moved from core LArSoft originally had copies in their original locations, but with “.sample” appended to the end of the filename. All of the “sample” files were removed in August, 2015.
