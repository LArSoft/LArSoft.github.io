When breaking changes are introduced in the code, they are usually documented more extensively in the [Breaking Changes](Breaking_Changes) page.  
Consider taking a look at it on each update, since the breakage could be subtler than just a compilation error.  
See [What to do when there is a new release](UpdatingToNewRelease)

See [Supported Platforms](Supported_Platforms) for a list of supported platforms.

Release versions in **bold font** will be preserved according to the [production release retention policy](LArSoft release naming policy).
