# OpticalDetectorData

This contains data classes associated with simulating the ADCs and FEM (Front-End Modules) associated with the optical detectors (PMTs). There's a little more information on the [optical simulations](optical_simulations) page.

As of June 2013, the classes in this package tend to be MicroBooNE-specific.
